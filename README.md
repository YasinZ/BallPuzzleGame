# BallPuzzleGame

Simple game I created for a school project. 
The game's primary mechanic control via the basic wasd controls. You play as a simple ball and solve puzzles with a twist at the end.
People who played the game said the movement was unforgiving. Overall was a learning experience creating levels as well at some basic platforming.
